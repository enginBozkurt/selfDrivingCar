*Trained DNN to identify common traffic signs and trained a Machine Learning architecture based on The Nvidia Model to predict steering angles
*Used Open CV to predict lanes and drive car to collect training and validations data for the algorithm
*Implemented Raspberry Pi as the main processing unit and used it to communicate with Pi camera and motors
